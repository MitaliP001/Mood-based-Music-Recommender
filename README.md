# 🎧 Mood-based Music Recommender (Python CLI)

This is a fun and smart Python CLI tool that recommends music based on your mood! It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand your feelings and suggest a fitting playlist.

## How It Works

1. You type how you're feeling (e.g., “I’m super tired and just want to relax”).
2. The app analyzes sentiment using **TextBlob**.
3. Based on sentiment score, it recommends a mood-aligned music playlist.

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `textblob` library

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
